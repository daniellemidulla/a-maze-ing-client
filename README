Test information:
 - To perform a build and run an automated test, change into the test/ directory and run BATS.sh.
 - To perform a unit test of the maze:
   -> from project directory, run 'make test' and then run './test/maze_test'
   -> from test/ directory, run 'make maze_test' and then run './maze_test'


Assumptions:
	Usage: maze -d difficulty -n nAvatars -h pierce.cs.dartmouth.edu

	The maze program can be made and run toplevel with the toplevel Makefile and a call to ./src/maze or in the src file with a call to the Makefile and ./maze.
	In order to run the program, you must use the flags -d -n and -h.
	The program assumes that in whatever directory it is being run, there exists a directory called logs in which to write output to. If this does not exist, maze will notify the end user and quit. 
	The program assumes the server running at pierce.cs.dartmouth.edu will send back Amazing information. If the correct messages are not recieved, the program will notify the user and quit. 

	Inputs:
	-d difficulty: a maze difficulty between 1 and 9 inclusive.
	-n nAvatars: a number of avatars between 1 and 10 inclusive.
	-h hostname: the hostname must always be pierce.cs.dartmouth.edu for this project.
